    // setTimeout is a Web API function that executes code after a specified delay
    // It takes two main arguments:
    //   1. A callback function to execute when the timer expires
    //   2. A time value in milliseconds that determines how long to wait

    setTimeout(function() {
        // This anonymous callback function will run after the specified delay
        // When executed, it will display an alert dialog to the user
        alert('Hello! I waited 3 seconds to show this');
    }, 3000); // 3000 milliseconds = 3 seconds

    // Important notes about setTimeout:
    // - It's non-blocking, meaning the rest of the code continues to execute
    // - The function is placed in the callback queue after the delay
    // - The function executes only when the call stack is empty (event loop)
    // - The timer is not guaranteed to be precise - it's a minimum wait time
